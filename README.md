# Gas_Detection_Using_Arduino


In this project, an Arduino microcontroller is employed in conjunction with an MQ-2 gas detector sensor. The system is designed to monitor gas levels, and a specific threshold is predefined. When the gas concentration surpasses this threshold, the Arduino triggers a simulation, visually represented by the illumination of an LED. This setup serves as a basic but effective gas detection and alert mechanism, allowing for real-time monitoring and response when potentially harmful gas levels are detected.
